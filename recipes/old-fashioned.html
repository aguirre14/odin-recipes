    <h1>Old Fashioned</h1>
    <img src="images/old-fashioned.jpg">
    <p>The Old Fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters and water, 
    adding whiskey, and garnishing with an orange slice or zest and a cocktail cherry. 
    It is traditionally served with ice in an old fashioned glass.</p> 
    <p> In this version, we will be simplifying the making by using sugar 
    syrup instead of sugar and water, and only an orange peel for garnishing</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>60ml Bourbon</ul>
    <ul>10ml Sugar syrup</ul>
    <ul>8 dashes of Angostura Bitters</ul>
    <ul>Orange peel</ul>
