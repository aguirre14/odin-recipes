Classic Cocktails repo!
At the end of the project, I will know how to setup a repository in GitHub, and how to move files to and from it, as well as using the Git Workflow to save snapshots of the work throughout the development. Working with text and hyperlinking are also skills I will have learnt in order to finish the project successfully.
